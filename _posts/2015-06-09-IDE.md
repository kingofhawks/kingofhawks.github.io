There are so many IDE out there, my preferred ones included:

* IDEA: [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?utm_expid=85132606-37.5-enLWJnTxyshuS9opeVLA.0) is the great Java IDE with community version.

* [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Also come from Intellij, the most wonderful Python IDE.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/): A hackable Editor based on Node.JS and Eletron.

* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/): A modern, open source text editor that understands web design.

* [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/): a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Cross-platform editor to build and debug modern web and cloud applications, based on Electron by Microsoft.

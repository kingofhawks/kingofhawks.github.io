So many Python distributions there:

### Anaconda

Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial use and redistribution). It includes over 195 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, data analysis(http://continuum.io/), includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Enthought Canopy

In addition to the features of Poole, https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/features/ Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

### ActivePython

ActiveState's ActivePython is the industry-standard Python distribution available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX and HP-UX (http://www.activestate.com/activepython).

### Pypy
PyPy (http://pypy.org/) is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language (2.7.8 and 3.2.5). It has several advantages and distinct features:
* Speed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy. (What is a JIT compiler?)
“If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum (creator of Python)
* Memory usage: memory-hungry Python programs (several hundreds of MBs or more) might end up taking less space than they do in CPython.
* Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports cffi and can run popular python libraries like twisted and django.
* Stackless: PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing micro-threads for massive concurrency



### Stackless
Stackless Python(http://www.stackless.com/) is an enhanced version of the Python programming language. It allows programmers to reap the benefits of thread-based programming without the performance and complexity problems associated with conventional threads. The microthreads that Stackless adds to Python are a cheap and lightweight convenience which can if used properly, give the following benefits:

* Improved program structure.
* More readable code.
* Increased programmer productivity.


### CPython
Official site(https://www.python.org/) for the interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language. Includes news, documentation, free downloads, and developer information.

Node.JS MVC & REST frameworks

### Express
   The most popular framework,it is rather easy to go with express for web development. But still callback hell.


### Meteor
   [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is the best real time framework so far, currently is tight bound with MongoDB. Also 
   
* DDP

* Mongodb&Minimongo

* ACL

### Loopback
   
   Backed by StrongLoop(which is behind Express), it is easy to build REST API with [loopback](http://loopback.io/), default support
   
both DBMS and MongoDB. Based on Express.


### Sails

   [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/#!) is another full stack framework based on Express, it default bundles ORM Waterline to support both DBMS and

MongoDB.Sails comes with blueprints that help jumpstart your backend REST API without writing any code.


### Koa

   TJ created [Koa](http://koajs.com/) to complete with Express,no middleware is locked in by default. It internally use ES6 generators to avoid 

callback hells.

   The problem for Koa seems lack of a good document.

Node.JS MVC & REST frameworks

### Express
   The most popular framework,it is rather easy to go with express for web development. But still callback hell.


### Meteor
   [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is the best real time framework so far, currently is tight bound with MongoDB. Also 
   
* DDP

* Mongodb&Minimongo

* ACL


### Sails

   [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/#!) is another full stack framework based on Express, it default bundles ORM Waterline to support both DBMS and

MongoDB.Sails comes with blueprints that help jumpstart your backend REST API without writing any code.



### Loopback
   
   [loopback](http://loopback.io/) is backed by commercial company StrongLoop(which is behind Express), which is based on Express and mainly focus on buildindg REST 
   
API, support both DBMS and MongoDB. 




### Koa

   TJ created [Koa](http://koajs.com/) to complete with Express,no middleware is locked in by default. It internally use ES6 generators to avoid 

callback hells.

   The problem for Koa seems lack of a good document.

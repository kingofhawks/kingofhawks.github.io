### Intent

Intent is a powerful concept within the Android universe. An intent is a message that can be thought of as a request that is given to either an

activity within your own app, an external application, or a built-in Android service.

Think of an intent as a way for an Activity to communicate with the outside Android world. A few key tasks that an intent might be used for within

your apps:

* Take the user to another screen (activity) within your application

* Take the user to a particular URL within the Android web browser

* Take the user to the camera to have them take a picture

* Initiate a call for the user to a given number



When you debug Android APP on real device, you need first enable "USB Debug" on device. Then install USB driver on PC.

* For Mi 3C, install [小米手机助手](http://zhushou.xiaomi.com/) or manually install USB driver as [Mi 3C USB Driver](http://www.xiaomi.cn/content-19-6735-1.html)

* For Sumsung phone, install [Kies](http://www.samsung.com/cn/support/usefulsoftware/KIES/)

* [Install USB Driver on Windows](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html)

When you run APP directly on Mi 3C, you need first make sure your device turn on USB debug mode. 

You just need to "Run" in Android Studio, and select the real device.

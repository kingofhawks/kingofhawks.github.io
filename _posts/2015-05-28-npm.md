[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) is defact standard package manager for node.js development, here are some usefule commands for npm:

* npm init: create package.json file
* npm install: install all packages defined in packages.json to /node_modules of current directory
* npm install lodash: install lodash to /node_modules of current directory
* npm install lodash --save: save as above plus update dependancies to package.json
* npm install -g lodash: install lodash globally

If you fail to install packages for GFW issue, please configure npm source:

> npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org

You could check your NPM configurations:

You can even upgrade npm itself: 

> npm install -g npm@latest. 

NPM is installed along with node.js, you could also reinstall node.js(which will upgrade node.js) to upgrade npm also.
